1. What is hoisting ?
	Hoisting is a default behaviour of javascript moving all the function declaration and variables to top of its scopes,
	prior to execution of the code OR
	
2. What is Closure ?
	An inner function getting access to the scope of outer function, In javascript closures are created everytime a function
	is created
	-> Function along with its Lexical Scope forms a Closure
	-> Whenever a function is returned even if it is vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was 
		pointing to, Its not just the function is returned but the entire closure
	
3. How Javascript works ?
	-> Javascript is a Synchronous single-threaded language
	-> Everything in javascript happens in a execution context
	-> Execution context is like a big box which has two components
	
		1. Memory Component (also called as Variable Enviroment)
			All the variable and functions are stored here as a key value pair
		
		2. Code Component ( also called as thread of execution )
			Here Code is executed as oneline at a time
			
4. How Javascript code is executed ?

	Example Code :	
	var n = 2;
	function square(num){
		var ans = num * num;
		return ans;
	}
	var square2 = square(n);
	var square4 = square(4);
	
	Considering the Above Code :
	-> Global Execution context is created ( Its like a big box, which has two components called as Memory Component and Code Component)
		
		Memory Component:
		-> On the First Phase it will allocate memory to all variables and functions
			n : undefined
			square : Copies the entire function
			square2 : undefined
			square4 : undefined
			
		Code Execution :
		-> On the Second Phase in code execution, It will again run the entire program line by line
		-> At line line 1 , Javascript assigns 2 as the value to variable n;
		-> Then starting from line 2 - 5, There is nothing for Javascript to do, Becuase here function is only written , No command to execute it
		-> Then to next line [square2], The function is called and a new execution context is created for that function, which again has	
			its memory component(allocating memory for variables and functions) and code component(runs the code line by line)
		-> Javascript runs the logic and returns the control as mentioned in the code
		
5. What is Call Stack ?
	Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution context
	
6. Differene between undefined and not defined ?
	In Javascript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them.
	If the variable which is being acessed doesnt exist in the memory space , then it would be not defined
	And if the variable is availabe in memory space but has not assigned any value till now, then it will be undefined
	
7. What is Scope or Lexical Enviroment ?
	Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.
	Lexical Enviroment is created whenever a Execution Context is created
	Lexical Enviroment is local memory + reference to lexical enviroment of (lexical) parent 
	
8. Differene between let, const and var ?
	-> Just as like var, let and const are also hoisted but due to Temporal Dead Zone , We cannot use them before initialization
	-> Temporal Dead Zone is time taken between declaration of a variable to assigning a value to it
	-> Javascript uses different memory space for storing let and const . Var is stored in global Execution
	-> let can be updated within its scope but const can neither be updaed nor redeclared
	
9. What is Block and Shadowing ?
	Code inside curly bracket is called block. Multiple statements are grouped inside a block so it can be written where
	JS expects single statements like in if, else, loop, function etc.
	Block values are stored inside separate memory than global. They are stored in block. (the reason let and const are called block scope)
	Shadowing of variables using var, let and const.
	
10. How to use Strict Mode ?

11. About Functions ?
	Differene between the function statement and function expression is hoisting, So considering the below two functions
	
	statement(); function doSomething(){}
	expression(); let doSomething = function(){}
	
	Output will be something like 
	Some Thing
	EXPRESSION IS NOT A FUNCTION. [Becuase global execution context considers expression as variable at first and the function is assigned 
		only during code execution phase]
	
	Function Statement also called as Function Declaration :
		function statement(){
			console.log("Some Thing");
		}
		
	Function Expression :
		var expression = function(){
			console.log("This is called function expression");
		}
		
	Anonymous Function:
		Anonymous Function are those function without names,
		
		Anonymous functions are used on place, where functions are used as values
		Example - var anonymousFun = function(){
		
					}
					
	Named Function Expression :
		var nameFunctionExpr = function xyz(){
			console.log("This is called as Named Function Expression");
		}
		
12. Differene between Parameters and Arguments
	[The lables or Identifires which get those values are known are Parameters]
	function addition(num1, num2){ 
		let sum = num1 + num2;
		return sum;
	}
	
	addition(5, 10); - The values which we pass inside a function are known as Arguments
	
13. What is First Class Function ?
	The ability of functions to be used as values and can be passed this as argument to another function and can be returned 
	from the function defines function as First Class FUNCTION
	
14. What is Call back function ?
	Functions that is passed as an argument to another function is called as Call Back Function.
	Ex - SetTimeout( function(){
					
					}, 5000)
				
					document.getElementById("myButton")
						.addEventListener("click", function(){
			
										})
										
					function xyx(getFunctionAsPara){
						getFunctionAsPara();
					}
					
					xyx(function(){
					
					})
					
15. Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookies ?
	Local Storage -
	-> Local Storage has storing capacity of upto 10 MB
	-> Local Storage never expires, unitl we write a delete logic or delete manually
	-> No data transfer to server
	-> Syntax - localStorage.setItem('key','values')
	
	Session Storage
	-> Session Storage has storing capacity of upto 5MB
	-> Its session based and works per window or tab
	-> As soon as the user visits the web app, the session is started and the data store in session is persisted only till the windows
	-> No data transfer to server
	
	Cookies
	
	
	

16. What is Prototypes ?
	-Every Object in Javascript has buitin property, which is called its prototype 
	-Using protoype, we can add new method and variables to the existing object
	-No matter how many objects you create, functions are loaded only once into the memory

17. Traditional way of creating a object in Javascript ?

18. Call(), Apply() and Bind() ?

	Call() - Allows you to borrow functions with different objects
	Ex : 
	printFullName(someParaOptional){
		console.log(this.firstName +' '+ this.lastName +' '+ someParaOptional)
	}
	let name = {
		firstName : 'Mohammed',
		lastName : 'Tabrez',
	}
	printFullName.call(name, 'vellore')
	
	Apply - The only difference with apply method is the way we pass arguments 
	Ex : 
	
	Bind - Bind will create a copy of that function. We can so store it in a variable so that it can be called later.
	
	

19. Object Destructruing ?
	let student = {
		name : "Tabrez",
		age : "29",
		email : "tabrez@gmail.com"
	}
	
	let { name } = student;
	
20. Array Destructruing ?
	const hobbies = ["Music", "Movies", "Reading", "Playing"];
	let [hobby1, hobby2] = hobbies;
	OUTPUT = hobby1 - Music AND hobby2 - Movies
	
21. What is Higer ordre function?
	A function that takes a function as paramenter and/or returns a function
	
22. What is Web API ?
	-> The features which are provided by the browser to be used along with our javascript code are considered as Web API's
	Example :
		-> setTimeout( ()=> {}, 5000)
		-> Dom API (like document.getElementById/getElementByClassName)
		-> Local Storage
		-> Console
		-> Location
		-> fetch()
		
23. What is Event Loop ?
	1. Browser has superpowers that are lent to JS engine to execute some tasks, these superpowers include web API's such as console, location, DOM API, setTimeout, fetch, local storage.
	2. Callback functions and event handers are first stored in Web API environment and then transferred to callback queue.
	3. Promises and mutation observer are stored in API environment and then transferred to microtask queue.
	4. Event loop continuously observes call stack and when it is empty it transfers task to call stack.
	5. Micro task is given priority over callback tasks.
	6. Too many micro tasks generated can cause Starvation (nit giving time to callback tasks to execute).
